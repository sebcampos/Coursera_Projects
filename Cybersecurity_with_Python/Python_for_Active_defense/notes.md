# Decoys
## Introduction to decoys
"All warefare is based on deception"
- Sun Tzu

* Cyberattackers commonly use deceptive tactics to hide their activities. Active defenders can employ deception as well:
    - Honeypots: decoy systems and data
    - Honey data: Fake data designed to distract and misdirect

* Deception and decoys provide a number of benefits for active defense:
    - Waste the attackers time
    - Allows the defender to control the attackers actions
    - Simplifies detection of threats on a system
    - Provides intelligence about an attackers TTPs

## Decoys for active defense
* Decoys can be used in active defense in several different ways. This course demonstrates three applications of decoys for active defense
    1. Decoy Processes
    2. Decoy content
    3. Decoy credentials

## Decoy Process for active defense
* A decoy process is a program masquerading as something else. Decoy proccesses can be applied to several active defense use cases:
    - Creation of artifacts directing attackers to decoy system
    - Making a system seem more vulnerable or enticing to an attacker
    - Influence an attackers behaviour based on processes present on a system


## Decoy content for active defense
* Decoy Content is misleading data placed on a system. Some applications of decoy content include:
    - Directing an attacker toward decoy systems
    - Observing an attackers presence on a system
    - Make decoy systems look more legitimate to an attacker


## Decoy credentials for active defense
* A defender can seed a system with fake credentials for an attacker to discover. This sets up a number of use cases including:
    - Directing an attacker to decoy systems 
    - Treacking an attackers access
    - Causing an attacker to steal fake data
    - wasting an attackers time with invalid credentials
