# Machine Learning
* Arthur Samuel (1959) Machine learning is the Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programed
* Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed learning problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E

## Main types of Machine Learning algorythms
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning

Others:
- Reinforcement Learning 
- recommender systems

## Supervised Learning
- we gave the dataset the 'right answers'
- Regression problems / continues valued output
- Classification problems deal with discrete valued outputs ie 0 or 1 (could be 0 1 2 3)

Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. 

## Unsupervised Learning
Computer / Algorythm is given data with no real identifiers. It attempts to sort out a structure for the data on its own
For example it might notice that there are two clusters of data points on each side of the data set ie some towered x01 and y01 and some other clustered towered xN and yN
with little or none in between. It would then split these 2 'clusters'
